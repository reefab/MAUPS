# MAUPS

MicroSlice Arduino Uno Pololu Shield.

As it says on the tin, this a shield to aggregate all the electronics for the [MicroSlice laser cutter](http://www.instructables.com/id/MicroSlice-A-tiny-Arduino-laser-cutter/).

I wasn't happy with the default electronic design of the project because I felt it was overly complicated by the creator's choice of using mostly off the shelf parts.

There isn't many components but a lot of connections and that made for a messy setup.

This [schematic](http://thelittlebox.co/theforum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=13&sid=64e7ffe73cd25b9ab61adbdb73844c2a#p58) will demonstrate the issue clearly.

## What I wasn't happy with

 * Reliance on wires instead of using a PCB
 * Unnecessary voltage regulators (not sure why it initially used a 5V fan)
 * Unnecessary relays where a MOSFET would do
 * Separate Laser drive
 * Easydrivers instead of Pololus (mostly a personal preference but also a tad cheaper).

## What does MAUPS provides

### PCB

![PCB](maups_pcb.png)

This is a shield for the Arduino Uno with everything plugging into it.

 * The 2 Pololus, replacing the 2 external easydrivers
 * The fan, without the external relay board or its voltage regulator board (if 5V)
 * The laser, without it's driver board
 * The motors
 * The endstops

Everything uses male Dupont connectors except for the laser and fan that uses screw terminals.

### Laser driver

The power supply for the laser is built-in into the shield. It's also controlled by a MOSFET now.
The power supply is based around a LM317 and requires a beefy radiator.

### Fan control

The fan is also controlled by a MOSFET.

## Inspiration

 * [LOG](https://www.logre.eu/wiki/Micro_Découpeuse/Graveuse_Laser) Grenoble's hackerspace
 * [RAMPS](http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4) For the name and concept
 * And of course SilverJimmy for the design of the MicroSlice
